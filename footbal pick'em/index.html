                <h3>Web Servers</h3>
                    <p><!--Explain what index means as it relates to websites and servers.-->
                        The use of index in the index.html file designates the file as the root directory or homepage for most web 
                        applications.  Web servers call this file the <strong>designated homepage</strong> and are configured to 
                        return it when they process the GET request received for / at the end of a URL.  Some web servers allow for the 
                        use of terms such as default.html, index.js, or index.php for the homepage. 
                    </p>
                    <p><!--Explain what can be seen in the browser's Web Dev/Inspector Network tab output screen. 
                        What is different about the file's details when viewed from the web server versus the local computer?-->
                        In the Web Dev/Inspector Network tab, there are lines to see the Request and Response Headers each file sent in the 
                        request and response.  When a line is selected, such as index.html, the tool shows the Request and Response Headers.  
                        In the Request Header we find the Request URL, the Request Method, what the client accepts for a response, encoding 
                        accepted and the optional body which is used when performing a post request.  In the Response Header there is a 
                        Status Line with the Response Code and the date of response date the response was last modified cache details, 
                        age, and the body of the response.  While comparing the response/request from a web server versus the one from the 
                        local host.  The one from a web server has a detailed description of the request that was sent and the one on the 
                        local server contains a provisional header that doesn't contain what is accepted for file types, encoding, and 
                        languages.  The Response Header for the local version contains Request Method, Status Code, content type and date 
                        last modified.  Where the web server Response Header shows the server response including the Request Method, Status 
                        Code, the date, and date last modified.
                    </p>
                    <p><!--Explain why the favicon.ico file has a status 200, but the main.css and main.js files do not.-->
                        Under the Web Dev/Inspector Network tab, the currently listed files show main.js and main.css both with a status of 
                        404, and a file named favicon.ico with a status of 200. The files main.js and main.css part of the request for index.html, 
                        as the main.css are not currently part of the file system and not found when the web client requested them.  The 
                        favicon.ico is part of the engineering web URL response file and since the file is found it shows as 200 OK.
                    </p>
                    <p><!--Explain the parts of the URL to your web file. What is the scheme, the subdomain, the host domain, 
                        and the resources?-->
                        The URL for this web file is https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~tylerbra/a1-tylerbra/. The first section, https: is 
                        the scheme.  This is an identifier to the web client what protocol it must use to request the resource.  Following 
                        the // in this URL are the subdomains web and engr which are subsections of the domain oregonstate.edu.  The domain is the 
                        location that the IP address is mapped to for the server.  The following parts /~tylerbra/a1-tylerbra are the path to
                        resource request, in this case this web page, and the final / indicates that the request is for the homepage or index.html.

                <h3>Frontend Design</h3>
                    <p><!--The concept of frontend design.-->
                        The process of creating an engaging and appropriate experience for the user is called frontend design.  This is done through the 
                        design of the graphical user-interface and the overall visual and interactive experience. The trends in frontend design change
                        regularly, but close attention to a cohesive color scheme, fonts, typography, media elements, and navigation system are required
                        to achieve an effective and enjoyable experience.  Key in achieving an enjoyable user experience is a design that has good usability.

                    <p><!--The purpose of each of the page layout tags.-->
                        A type of <strong>block-level element</strong>, the page layout tags separating the content from other content with a 
                        newline before and after it.  HTML 5 added these tags so that different areas weren't sectioned off, only using a div element 
                        for each section. The <strong>header element</strong> is used for the masthead of a site or app and usually includes name, publisher, and 
                        the marketing slogan.  It is kept the same on the different pages to help users know they are on the same site. The <strong>nav element</strong>
                        is used to help users navigate between pages, to external resources, and different portions of the current page. The <strong>main element</strong>
                        is the primary block that holds the pages content like stories, media, and tutorials.  A <strong>section element</strong> groups content that 
                        follows a common theme, but isn't enough to be stand-alone content.  An <strong>article element</strong> typically is found in a section element 
                        and covers a specific topic. Article elements typically are found within a section element.  Three ways to connect relating content not directly 
                        relevant to the article are using the <strong>aside element</strong>,<strong> figure element</strong> and the <strong>blockquote element</strong>.  
                        An aside element floats to the side of the article with a distinguishing style.  The figure element typically contains media along with 
                        the figure caption for the media.  A blockquote element is visually different from the article and used for a quote that is too long
                        for a paragraph.  Residing after the closing main tag, the <strong>footer element</strong> is used for legal and or contact information, links to 
                        critical resources and the copyright information.  <strong>Div elements</strong> are used for dynamic content that is outside the structure of other
                        page layout tags.

                        <li><strong>External anchors</strong> create links to resources using a URL or <strong>absolute path</strong> that is outside the current website</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal anchors</strong> create links to other resources on the same page by using ID as attributes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Page-to-page anchors</strong> link pages together using portions of the directories URL called <strong>relative path</strong> links.  These links are 
                        usually found in the nav section of a page and can be styled as buttons.</li>

                <h3>Optimizing Images</h3>
                    <p><!--What are the 6 major specifications of images for the web? And why>-->
                        Images for web use need a <strong>descriptive file name</strong>, improving search engine optimization (SEO).  Adding succinct yet descriptive file names so search engine bots can better categorize it and present the image when users are performing a related image search.  A <strong>small file size</strong> promotes the fastest possible loading times.  This can be accomplished by providing high resolution images only to devices that can properly render them using the srcset="" and sizes="" attributes.  The compressing of files size can take one of two approaches.  Either using <strong>Lossy</strong> compression which discards some image data, with some degradation (pixelation) of the image is possible, or <strong>Lossless</strong> compression which does not lose image quality however there is a smaller reduction in file size. Another image specification that needs to be addressed when working with images is the <strong>exact dimensions</strong> of the space within the web page.  Serving an image that is larger than the available space will cause the image to load with a significant delay.  Using the <strong>correct file format</strong> such as .JPG for photos, .GIF or 8-bit .PNG for logos and icons, and 24-bit .PNG for graphics with true transparency are ways to optimize images.  As monitors render between 72 and 300+ pixels per inch (ppi) having multiple images including <strong>reduced resolution</strong> images to meet the older default 72ppi spec will help to optimizing the user experience.  Finally, choosing the correct <strong>color mode</strong> of RGB for .PNG, .JPG, .SVG, and WebP files, and Indexed, sometimes .PNG, for .GIF.  
                    </p>
                    <p><!--Which file formats are most appropriate for photos and line art? And why?-->
                        Photographic images are often taken on high resolution cameras and have millions of colors, great detail, resulting in large file sizes.  Using file formats such as .JPG and .WebP allows for resizing and compression of the image files, resulting in a reduced load on the web server.  These file formats both retain the rectangular shape and have exceptional compression characteristics.  Line art images work best with .SVG, .GIF, and .PNG.  These file formats all have excellent compression.  Using .SVG on two-dimensional, interactive or animated images results in a mathematically derived file with sharp text and edges. Files saved using the .GIF can be animated, 8-bit transparency, and are saved in indexed color mode.  The best file format for organic shapes, line art and solid colors is the .PNG file format.

                <h3>Favicons</h3>
                    <p><!--How do browsers and devices use favicons?-->
                        Favicons are icons used to represent a brand or website and are frequently found in the browser tab next to the title of the web page.  Favicons also help with site identification on wearables, cellphones, and search engine results.  Starting as a symbol and then modified to work best on multiple devices and saved in multiple sizes and formats so that the device can use the one that works best.  Browsers get the files and then can save the icon for a bookmark, favorites list or the device screen.
